My name is Ebru Geçici and I am an Industrial Engineer. I graduated from the Yıldız Technical University and now I am the Master student at Boğaziçi University. At the same time, I work in the Yıldız Technical University as an academic researcher. 

In my academic journey, I especially study optimization problems such as shift scheduling, exam and course scheduling problem, and also energy modeling with mathematical modeling. In addition to these studies, I started to interest the data project. For this purpose, I got some online courses about R Programming. I hope that this course will be an important milestone in my studies.
