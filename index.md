### IE48A - SPECIAL TOPICS in Essentials of Data Analysis

### **Assignments**

### Assignment 1: *R Markdown*


The R Markdown assignment consists of the creating a new R Markdown file and analysing of some blogs, pages, and videos, which are related to **R**.
The information in the assignment 1 is related to Covid-19 and R combination. In additon to that, this assignment also includes information about my academic background. 

- [R Markdown](Introduction.html)


### Assignment 2: *Electricty Market Price*

The second assignment is related to implementation and practise of the dplyr() function and ggplot() function.
By using EPIAS 01-31 July 2020 data, some examples are made in this assignment.

### Assignment 3: *Diamond Price Estimation*

In the third individual, there are three different options to present and it is expected that one of these are chosen to make analysis. For this reason, I select `diamond price estimation`.

### Assignment

In the first assignment by using [airbnb data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data), we prepare exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data. For this purpose, we prepare

- Shiny App: [html](https://pjournal.github.io/boun01g-data-mine-r-s/Assignment/Airbnb_Shiny.html)

### Project

In the group project, we analyze the 2020 online car market Turkey by using [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alpertemel/turkey-car-market-2020) data set. The aim of this study is that (i) to provide exploratory analysis by using `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, etc. and (ii) to create a model for predicting of the car data. Hence, first we prepare a proposal, then we make an EDA report and shiny app. Lastly, we present a model to obtain final report of the project. You can reach our report by using following links:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: [html](https://pjournal.github.io/boun01g-data-mine-r-s/Project/ExploratoryDataAnalysis.html)
- Shiny App:
- Final Report: 

### Bonus: *data.table*

For bonus projcet, we choose [data.table](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html). In this project, first we create a tutorial to explain this package and record a video to show information which we learn. 

### **Exercises**

### Week 3

In this exercise, there is a basic shiny app implementation can be found. In this example Movies are used to create inteactive ggplot application by using shiny() package.

### Week 4

**Exercise 1**: The trial of the implementation of the join function. In this example, the course examples are re-maded to understand the logic of the `join()` function. You can also reach these examples in course page.
